The goal of the project is to create an interactive
system that displays a countdown for our current
sales goal of 20 contracts. 

The system is made up of a Raspberry Pi and a
Button. The RPi hosts a webserver that serves a web
page that uses AJAX for communication between a
client (someone viewing the countdown) and the RPi 
which is also monitoring for Button presses.

The count is decremented on each button press and 
clients post back to the server every second to see
if the "count" has changed. If so, the new count is
displayed on the web page.
